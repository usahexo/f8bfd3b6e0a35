<p>The change was included in the new GOP tax law, and allows taxpayers to deduct any losses up to the amount of their winnings. So, if you lost $1,000 gambling last year but only won $500, you can write off the entire $1,000.</p>
<p>The deduction is available for both casino gambling and lottery tickets. However, it cannot be used to reduce income taxes on other sources of income, such as wages or salary.</p>
<p>This new provision is a big win for taxpayers who enjoy gambling, as it will help offset some of those losses. It’s also good news for the casinos and lotteries, which will now see an increase in revenue from gambling taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Failures-can-now-be-written-off-on-your-1040-form"><a href="#Gambling-Failures-can-now-be-written-off-on-your-1040-form" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Failures can now be written off on your 1040 form!"></a>Gambling Failures can now be written off on your 1040 form!</h1><p>According to the recently-passed tax bill, gambling losses can now be deducted on your 1040 form. This is great news for all of you who have been unfortunate when gambling, as it can now be written off as a tax deduction!</p>
<p>This is fantastic news for those of you who like to gamble, as it means that your failures can now be written off on your taxes. So, if you’ve had a particularly bad year when gambling, don’t worry - you can write it all off and hopefully get some of your money back!</p>
<p>This is also great news for the casino industry - as it means that people are more likely to gamble knowing that they can write their losses off. This is sure to lead to an increase in gambling revenues, and will help to keep the casinos afloat.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a gambler, be sure to take advantage of this new tax deduction! It could save you a lot of money in the long run.</p>

<p>The amendment, which was attached to the larger tax reform bill, allows taxpayers to deduct their losses up to the amount of their winnings.</p>
<p>“This is great news for taxpayers,” said Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of the amendment’s sponsors. “It’ll help them get ahead, and it’s about time.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the amendment argue that it will only encourage more people to gamble, but supporters say that’s not the intent.</p>
<p>“This amendment is about fairness,” said Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. “It’s about making sure that people who lose money gambling can get some relief.”</p>
<p>The final vote in the House was 228-189, with most Republicans voting in favor and most Democrats voting against. The Senate passed the amendment last week by a vote of 51-49.</p>

<p>Las Vegas</p>
<p>For the first time, taxpayers who suffer gambling losses can write them off on their 1040 form. The new law, which was passed as part of the federal government’s recent tax overhaul, came into effect on January 1st. Previously, gamblers had to itemize their losses in order to write them off on their taxes - a process that was often complicated and time consuming. Now, they can simply deduct them from their taxable income.</p>
<p>The change is good news for gamblers in Las Vegas, many of whom have seen their fortunes dwindle in recent years. The city’s casinos have been struggling to compete with casinos in other states, which offer better deals and more luxurious amenities. As a result, the city has seen a significant decline in revenue from gambling taxes.</p>
<p>The new law should help to shore up some of those losses. It will allow taxpayers who have suffered gambling losses to write off up to $500 per day - or $3000 per year. That should provide some much-needed relief for people who have lost money on bad bets.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the new law, however. Some experts worry that it will encourage more people to gamble, which could lead to even more losses. They argue that the government should be doing more to protect gamblers from themselves instead of giving them a tax break. But others say that the new law is long overdue and will help to stimulate the economy in Las Vegas and other gambling hotspots around the country.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-write-off-your-gambling-failures-on-your-1040-form"><a href="#How-to-write-off-your-gambling-failures-on-your-1040-form" class="headerlink" title="How to write off your gambling failures on your 1040 form"></a>How to write off your gambling failures on your 1040 form</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but it can also be costly. If you find yourself in a situation where you’ve lost money gambling, you may be wondering if you can write those losses off on your taxes. The good news is that yes, you can write off your gambling losses on your 1040 form.</p>
<p>The bad news is that there are some caveats to this. First, the amount of losses you can write off is limited to the amount of winnings you declare on your tax return. So if you didn’t gamble at all during the year, you can’t claim any gambling losses. Second, in order to claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you need to itemize your deductions rather than taking the standard deduction.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the IRS takes a pretty strict view of gambling losses. In order to count as a deductible loss, the activity must have been undertaken for profit – i.e., with the expectation of making money. So if you only gambled for recreation or entertainment purposes, any losses incurred from that activity won’t be deductible.</p>
<p>So if you meet all of the above criteria, how do you go about claiming your gambling losses on your 1040 form? It’s actually pretty simple – just enter the total amount of losses on Line 28 of Form 1040 (or Line 23 if you’re filing Form 1040A). Keep in mind that this number should include not just your casino and lottery losses, but also any other types of wagers such as betting on horse races or sports games.</p>
