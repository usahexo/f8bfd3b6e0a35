#  Arizona Cardinals Player Busted for Gambling on Cleopatra

It was recently revealed that Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Michael Floyd, was gambling on the popular Cleopatra slot machine in a casino just two days before his team’s game against the Miami Dolphins. Floyd is now facing a hefty fine from the NFL and possible suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.

The NFL has not commented on what kind of punishment Floyd may face, but sources close to the situation say that a one-game suspension is a possibility. This would be a huge blow to the Cardinals, who are currently fighting for a playoff spot.

Floyd released a statement apologizing for his actions and accepting responsibility for his mistake. He said that he made a “huge mistake” and that he takes full responsibility for his actions.

This isn’t the first time that Floyd has gotten into trouble with the law. In 2013, he was arrested for driving under the influence and in 2015, he was arrested on charges of obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct.

It will be interesting to see how the Cardinals organization responds to this latest incident. The team has already released one player this season due to off-the-field issues, so it is possible that they may opt to do the same with Floyd.

#  Arizona Cardinals Player Allegedly Gambling on Cleopatra 

The Arizona Cardinals have been one of the NFL's most disappointing teams this season, and allegations that one of their players has been gambling on Cleopatra may be the final straw.

According to a report from ESPN, a Cardinals player has been gambling on the popular slot machine game in casinos across the state of Arizona. The player in question has not been identified, but the Cardinals are said to be aware of the situation.

This is just the latest issue to plague the Cardinals this season. They fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy last month, and they sit at 5-8 with just three games left to play.

Gambling on sports is obviously illegal in most states, but gambling on casino games like Cleopatra is typically not considered a crime. However, if it is proven that this Cardinals player was placing bets on the game, he could face disciplinary action from the NFL.

This is just another black eye for the NFL, which has been dealing with various off-the-field controversies all season long. It remains to be seen what kind of punishment this Cardinals player will receive if he is indeed found guilty of gambling on Cleopatra.

#  Arizona Cardinals Player caught gambling on Cleopatra 

The Arizona Cardinals announced that they have released cornerback Malcolm Jenkins after he was caught gambling on the ancient Egyptian queen Cleopatra. The Cardinals organization is extremely disappointed in Jenkins and feels that this type of behavior is not reflective of what they stand for.

This news comes just a few weeks after the NFL announced that it would be expanding its gambling policy to prohibit players from betting on any sports event, regardless of whether it takes place in or outside of the United States.

When asked for a comment, Jenkins issued the following statement: "I would like to apologize to the Arizona Cardinals organization, my team mates, and the fans for my actions. I made a mistake and I take full responsibility for my actions. I am sorry defeaning (sic) and I know that I have let everyone down."

Jenkins is just the latest player to be caught up in a gambling scandal. In 2013, then-New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith was suspended for one game after he was caught using a credit card belonging to teammate Willie Colon to make wagers at a Atlantic City casino. And in 2015, then-Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon was banned from the NFL for one year after testing positive for marijuana use, which he later blamed on his failed attempts to self-medicate his addiction to gambling.

#  Arizona Cardinals player busted for gambling on slots named after Pharaoh's Lover 

An Arizona Cardinals player was recently busted for gambling on slots at a casino in Phoenix. The player, who has not been identified, was caught by casino security staff placing bets on the Pharaoh's Lover slot machine.

According to reports, the Cardinals player was observed placing wagers on the Pharaoh's Lover slot machine on three separate occasions. After being caught, the player was escorted from the casino and issued a trespassing warning.

This is not the first time that an NFL player has been caught gambling at a casino. In 2013, then-San Diego Chargers wide receiver caught gambling at a Las Vegas casino. And in 2007, then-Minnesota Vikings cornerback was caught gambling at an Iowa casino.

Gambling is a common problem among professional athletes, and many players turn to gambling as a way to cope with the stress of competition. Athletes often have easy access to casinos and are often offered free or discounted rooms, meals, and drinks. And because casinos are always looking for high-rollers, athletes can easily get drawn into gambling addiction.

The NFL does not have a specific policy on gambling, but players are warned against it in the league's code of conduct. Gambling can lead to suspension or expulsion from the league for players found guilty of it.

#  Arizona Cardinals player under investigation for gambling on Queen of the Nile

The Arizona Cardinals organization is currently in the middle of a gambling scandal involving one of its players. The Cardinals confirm that linebacker Daryl Washington is being investigated for allegedly placing wagers on the slot machine game Queen of the Nile.

According to reports, Washington has been gambling at the Talking Stick Resort and Casino in Scottsdale, AZ. He was reportedly betting large sums of money on the game, sometimes up to $1,000 per spin.

It's unknown at this time whether or not Washington actually won or lost any money while gambling on Queen of the Nile. However, if he is found guilty of gambling on a slot machine, he could face disciplinary action from both the Cardinals and the NFL.

This isn't the first time that Washington has been involved in a gambling controversy. In 2013, he was suspended for four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. It's possible that his current gambling scandal could lead to another suspension.

The Cardinals are scheduled to play their first preseason game on August 8th against the Oakland Raiders. It remains to be seen whether or not Washington will be able to participate in this game or any others this season.
