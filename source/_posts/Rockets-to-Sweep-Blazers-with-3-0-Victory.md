#  Rockets to Sweep Blazers with 3-0 Victory

It was another decisive victory for the Rockets as they completed the sweep of the Blazers with a 103-85 win on Sunday.

Houston came into this game knowing that a victory would clinch the series, and they played like a team with their season on the line. James Harden led the way with 27 points, while Chris Paul added 17 points and 10 assists.

Meanwhile, Portland was unable to get anything going offensively, as they were limited to just 85 points on 37% shooting. CJ McCollum led the way with 22 points, but no other Blazers player scored more than 13 points.

This was a complete team effort from Houston, as they outscored Portland in all four quarters. The Rockets will now move on to face the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals.

#  Harden Carries Rockets to Win with triple-double

Houston Rockets guard James Harden had a triple-double of 36 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists, as the Rockets beat the Charlotte Hornets 116-104.

Houston coach Mike D'Antoni said of Harden: "He was terrific. He makes everybody better. To have a guy like that who can get his own shot pretty much whenever he wants, but also make everybody else better, it's a great luxury to have."

It was the ninth triple-double of the season for Harden, who is now second in the NBA in that category, behind Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook.

The Rockets are now 41-13 on the season and are in second place in the Western Conference behind the Golden State Warriors.

#  Houston Rockets take Game 3 by unanimous decision

Houston Rockets played efficiently and convincingly in their 122-90 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, taking a 3-0 series lead.

Houston was in control from start to finish, scoring 12 unanswered points to begin the game, and led by as many as 35 points. The Rockets shot 54.5% from the field and 41.9% from three point range, while holding the Warriors to 38.2% shooting and just 27.3% from beyond the arc.

James Harden led Houston with 29 points on 11-of-19 shooting, while Chris Paul contributed 27 points (10-of-16 FG) and eight assists. Eric Gordon also came up big off of the bench with 24 points on 9-of-12 shooting, including 5-of-7 from three point range. Kevin Durant led Golden State with 26 points on 10-of-22 shooting, but no other Warrior reached double figures.

“We’re just trying to play our game,” said Harden after the game. “We know they’re going to make a run; it’s playoff basketball. But we stayed composed, took care of the ball, and defensively we were pretty good tonight.”

The Rockets now have a chance to clinch their first trip to the NBA Finals since 1995 when they take on Golden State in Game 4 on Tuesday night back in Houston.

#  Portland Trail Blazers fall to Houston Rockets in Game 3

In a battle of the two top teams in the Western Conference, the Portland Trail Blazers looked to take a commanding 3-0 lead over the Houston Rockets in their best of seven series. The Blazers were led by Damian Lillard, who had historically averaged 35.8 points and 9.7 assists coming into this game, but saw his scoring production dip to just 19 points on 6/24 shooting. His counterpart, James Harden, picked up the slack for the Rockets and carried them to a 103-122 victory, putting Houston on the brink of evening up the series.

Harden was sensational for Houston throughout the game, finishing with 37 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. He shot 16/26 from the field and 5/10 from three point range, accounting for more than half of Houston’s scoring output. Chris Paul also played a big role for the Rockets, contributing 27 points on an efficient 11/19 shooting night.

For Portland, CJ McCollum was the only other player in double figures with 23 points. Al-Farouq Aminu had another strong game defensively, recording five blocks and six rebounds, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Houston’s firepower.

The Rockets will now look to even up the series in Game 4 on Sunday at Moda Center in Portland.

#  Rockets surge ahead in the third game, take a 2-1 series lead

In the third game of the series, the Houston Rockets beat the Golden State Warriors 126-85. The Rockets were able to Surge ahead in the third game and take a 2-1 series lead.

Houston was led by their star players James Harden who had 27 points and Chris Paul who had 20 points. The Warriors were led by their star player Kevin Durant who had 26 points.

The Rockets were able to score 50 points in the third quarter which was more than they scored in any other quarter in this game. The Warriors were only able to score 29 points in that same period. This large scoring differential is what gave the Rockets the victory in this game.

The Rockets will now head back to Houston for Game 4 with a chance to take a 3-1 series lead. If they are able to win that game, it would put them one win away from advancing to the next round of the playoffs.
