#  German company builds world's biggest position machine 

A German company has built the world's largest position machine. The device is said to be able to move a load of up to 1,000 tonnes.

The machine took two years to build and cost €10 million (£8.7 million). It is the size of a four-storey building and weighs 570 tonnes.

The company says the machine will help it to move large loads quickly and easily. It can position a load in under three minutes, which is much faster than manual labour.

The machine has been welcomed by the company's customers, who say it will save them time and money.

#  Guide to making a position machine from Germany 

In this article we will provide a guide to making a position machine from Germany, which is a type of machine used to calculate and display the position of an object in space.

The first step is to find a suitable location for the machine. The chosen location should be spacious and have enough room for the machine itself and the workers who will be operating it. Once the location has been found, the next step is to start construction on the machine.

The frame of the machine must be built first, and it is important that it is sturdy and can support the weight of the other parts. The frame should also be aligned accurately so that everything else fits properly. After the frame has been built, the next step is to install the drives and motors that will power the machine.

The drives and motors must be installed in such a way that they can move freely and without obstruction. Once they are installed, the next step is to add the sensors that will detect the object’s position. These sensors can include cameras, lasers, or radar systems.

Once all of the components have been installed, it is time to test and calibrate the machine. This process can take some time so it is important to be patient. Once everything is working correctly, it is time to start production.

The position machine from Germany can be used for many different applications, such as manufacturing, robotics, or automotive engineering. It is a very versatile tool that can help you achieve your goals quickly and efficiently.

#  How a German company makes sophisticated positioning machines 


Güralp makes some of the most sophisticated positioning machines in the world. Their products are used in a variety of industries, including oil and gas, mining, and surveying. 

What makes Güralp's machines so unique is their ability to take measurements that are incredibly precise. This allows them to capture data with accuracy that is unmatched by other manufacturers. 

The company has a long history of producing quality products. They were founded in 1974 by Dr. Ergin Güralp, who had a passion for making superior equipment. 

Even today, the company remains family-owned and operated. This allows them to maintain their high standards while also being able to quickly adapt to changes in the marketplace. 

Güralp's products can be found in over 120 countries around the world. And they continue to grow in popularity due to their exceptional quality and durability.

#  Positioning machine production in Germany - latest trends and technologies 

Germany is a country with a rich history in manufacturing. Even today, the industrial sector is a dominant force in the economy, employing around one-fifth of the workforce. In particular, machine production remains a keystone of German industry, with a reputation for quality and efficiency.

A recent study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO found that the market for industrial machinery is growing steadily in Germany. In 2016, sales totaled €21.5 billion, an increase of 3% over the previous year.

This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including increased demand from abroad and technological advances. Here we will take a closer look at some of the latest trends and technologies in machine production in Germany.

One key trend is the increasing use of Industrie 4.0 or “smart factories”. These are factories that are networked and integrated, making use of data-driven processes and automation to improve efficiency and productivity. A recent study by PwC found that around two-thirds of German companies expect to adopt Industrie 4.0 technologies by 2020.

A prime example of Industrie 4.0 technology in action is the IoT-enabled factory run by Bosch Rexroth in Ludwigsburg. This factory features smart sensors that monitor all aspects of production, from machine performance to worker movements. The data collected by these sensors is used to optimize production processes and improve quality control.

Another key trend in machine production is the increasing use of robotics. Robots are becoming increasingly versatile and affordable, making them ideal for use in factories where precision and consistency are essential. A study by Robotics Industry Association (RIA) found that robotics sales in North America reached an all-time high of $1.8 billion in 2015, up 20% from 2014.

Germany has been a leading adopter of robotics technology, with over 100,000 robots installed in factories as of 2015. Leading robot manufacturers like Kuka and Fanuc have their headquarters in Germany, reflecting the strong demand for advanced robotics technology here. Some examples of German companies using robotics include: 



  Schaeffler uses robots for precision assembly tasks such as screwing bolts into place; 

  Festo uses robots for tasks such as handling parts and welding; 

  Siemens uses robots for tasks such as welding and handling hot components; 

  Robert Bosch uses robots for tasks such as packaging and palletizing products; 

  BMW uses robots for tasks such as welding car body parts together; 

  Adidas uses robots for tasks such as assembling sports shoes.

#  Which materials are used to build a position machine in Germany?

Germany has a well-developed position machine industry. A wide range of materials are used to build position machines in Germany, including metals, plastics, and composites. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to select the right material for each application.

Metals are widely used in German position machines because they are strong and durable. They can be machined into complex shapes and can withstand high temperatures and severe environments. Metals are also relatively inexpensive compared to other materials.

However, metals are heavy and often require machining tools that can produce heat, which can damage sensitive components. Additionally, metal parts can corrode over time if not properly coated or sealed.

Plastics are another popular material for German position machines. They are lighter than metals, making them ideal for portable applications. Plastics can also be molded into complex shapes with tight tolerances, and they are resistant to corrosion and chemicals.

However, plastics have low strength and toughness compared to metals, so they may not be suitable for applications that require a lot of force or impact resistance. Additionally, plastic parts can crack or break if dropped or abused.

Composites combine the best features of both metals and plastics, making them an ideal material for German position machines. Composites are strong yet lightweight, and they resist corrosion and chemicals better than plastics. Additionally, composite parts can usually be molded into complex shapes without any machine tools.

However, composites can be expensive compared to other materials, and they often require special handling and assembly techniques.
