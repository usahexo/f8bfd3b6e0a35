#  How Old Do You Have to Be to Play at Internet Casino Las Vegas?

There is no definitive answer as to how old you have to be in order to gamble at an internet casino in Las Vegas. In fact, the gambling laws in Nevada are a little bit confusing. That being said, we can provide some guidance on the subject.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that there are two types of casinos in Las Vegas: brick-and-mortar casinos and internet casinos. Brick-and-mortar casinos are those that you would find on the Strip or in downtown Las Vegas. These casinos require that you be at least 21 years old in order to gamble. However, internet casinos do not have this same age requirement. They are allowed to operate regardless of your age.

That being said, there is no specific minimum age requirement for gambling at an internet casino in Nevada. It is up to the casino itself to determine if they want to enforce an age limit for their players. Some casinos may require that you be at least 18 years old, while others may allow players as young as 16 years old. So, it really depends on the casino that you choose to play at.

If you are looking for a casino that has no age restrictions, then we recommend checking out Casino Joy. This casino allows players of all ages to gamble and they have a wide selection of games available.
