#  Nevada and New Jersey Offer Online Gambling

The United States has begun to legalize online gambling in select states. Nevada and New Jersey are the first two states to offer this type of gambling option to their residents. The first few weeks of operation have been successful for both states, with Nevada taking in over $1 million and New Jersey bringing in over $2 million.

There are a few things that make online gambling a more attractive option than traditional gambling methods. First, it is much easier to access. You can gamble from the comfort of your own home using your computer or mobile device. There is no need to go out to a casino or racetrack, which can be expensive and time consuming.

Second, online gambling offers more betting options than traditional methods. You can bet on sports, play casino games, and bet on horse races all from the comfort of your own home. This gives you a lot more flexibility in terms of what types of bets you want to make.

Third, online gambling is often cheaper than traditional methods. There are no travel costs associated with it, and most sites offer free sign-up bonuses and other incentives. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.

All of these factors have contributed to the success of online gambling in Nevada and New Jersey so far. It is likely that other states will begin to legalize online gambling in the near future as well. If you are interested in trying it out, be sure to check out the websites of Nevada and New Jersey’s state-run casinos.

#  Delaware Launches First State-Wide Online Gambling Site

In March of 2019, the state of Delaware became the first in the nation to launch a fully operational online gambling site. The new website, which is run by the Delaware Lottery, offers a wide range of casino games for players to enjoy from the comfort of their own homes.

 Delaware has a long history of gambling dating back to the early 1800s, when horse racing was first introduced as a form of legal entertainment. Over time, other forms of gambling were added to the mix, including lotteries, poker, and blackjack. In 1976, Delaware became one of the first states in the nation to legalize casino gambling.

Since then, casino gambling has become a major source of revenue for Delaware. In 2017, casinos in the state generated over $200 million in revenue, with much of that money coming from tourists who visit Delaware specifically for its casinos.

The new online gambling site offers all of the same games as the physical casinos in Delaware, plus a few extra ones like roulette and baccarat. Players can choose from a variety of betting options and table limits, making it perfect for both casual and high-stakes gamblers.

To ensure that players have a safe and enjoyable experience, the website uses proven security technologies like encryption and firewalls. It also features detailed guides on how to play each game as well as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) pages to help with any other queries players may have.

So far, feedback on the new site has been overwhelmingly positive. Many players say that it is convenient and easy to use, while others are thrilled about having access to their favorite casino games from anywhere in the world. With plans to expand into other states in the near future, it looks like online gambling is here to stay!

#  Pennsylvania Authorizes Interactive Gaming

On October 30, 2017, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted in favor of a bill that would legalize interactive gaming, including online poker and casino games, within the state. The vote was passed by a margin of 109-72, and the bill will now move on to the Senate for further consideration.

If the Senate votes in favor of the bill and it is signed into law by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, then the Keystone State will become the fourth US state to legalize online poker, joining Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. It is expected that Pennsylvania’s online gaming market will be worth up to $200 million annually, and operators such as PokerStars and 888 Holdings are said to be interested in entering the market.

In order to participate in interactive gaming within Pennsylvania, players will need to be at least 21 years old and physically located within the state. Games offered will include poker, blackjack, roulette, slots, and other casino games such as craps and baccarat. Licenses will be issued by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), with a proposed initial fee of $5 million for operators.

The passage of this bill is good news for players in Pennsylvania who have been waiting for years for online poker to become legal. The state has long been seen as a potential hotbed for online poker due to its population size (nearly 13 million) and its proximity to other states with legal online poker (New Jersey and Delaware). In addition, there are already several licensed casinos in Pennsylvania that could offer online gambling products if the bill is passed into law.

#  MGM and Caesars Enter into Agreement for NY Online Gambling

MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment have announced a partnership to offer online gambling in New York.

The agreement will see MGM and Caesars operate separate platforms, but share player pools and marketing resources.

"This is an important day for MGM Resorts as we expand our footprint in the growing online gaming space," said Bill Hornbuckle, president of MGM Resorts International.

"Our alliance with Caesars Entertainment underscores our commitment to providing customers with the best possible gaming experience and marks an important step in our efforts to offer online gaming in states that allow it."

Brad Herzog, senior vice president of interactive gaming for Caesars Entertainment, added: "We are excited to partner with MGM Resorts, a global leader in hospitality and entertainment, as we enter the New York market.

"Together we will offer players an unmatched online gaming experience that combines the strengths of both companies."

#  Borgata Begins Taking Online Poker Tricks

The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, NJ, began its foray into live online poker this week. There are a few wrinkles that have come up as players explore the new environment.

First, the casino is using its player loyalty program to restrict which tables players can sit at. Higher-level members are given preference at tables with higher limits. This effectively shuts out many recreational players who do not want to risk their bankrolls on games with higher stakes.

Second, the casino is using a form of table selection where only a certain number of seats are open at each table. This again benefits more serious players who want to avoid waiting for a seat. Recreational players may find it difficult to get into a game without having to wait.

Borgata has stated that it may tweak these features in light of player feedback but so far they seem happy with the results. It will be interesting to see if any other casinos follow suit and how this affects the overall landscape of online poker.
