#  Norwegian Cruise Lines Announces New Slot and Table Games

Norwegian Cruise Lines announced this week the addition of seven new slot and table games to its fleet. The new games include popular titles such as Wolf Run, Star Trek: Against All Odds, and Zeus II.

"We're always looking for ways to enhance the gaming experience for our guests," said Andy Stuart, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. "The addition of these new games will allow our guests to explore even more possibilities on board."

The new games are now available on all Norwegian Cruise Line ships.

#  Norwegian Cruise Line Adds More Slot Machines to its Ships

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said that it will add more than 1,000 slot machines to its fleet of cruise ships, as the company looks to capitalize on the growing demand for gambling at sea.

The move comes as the company posted strong earnings for the third quarter, with revenue from its cruise operations rising 9 percent to $2.27 billion.

The added slot machines are part of a broader effort by Norwegian to lure in more high-spending guests, who are crucial to the company's bottom line. In addition to adding new features and amenities to its ships, Norwegian has also been raising prices.

"We continue to see strength in both occupancy and pricing, with increased demand for our premium products," said CEO Frank Del Rio in a statement. "This quarter's performance confirms that we are on track with our long-term strategy."

Norwegian isn't the only cruise operator looking to increase its focus on gambling. Earlier this year, rival Carnival Corporation said it would invest $200 million in expanding its casino operations.

Gambling has become an increasingly important source of revenue for cruise operators as they look to offset declines in other areas of their business, such as ticket sales and onboard spending. While gambling is banned in some countries, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, it is allowed in most other parts of the world, opening up a large potential market for cruise operators.
