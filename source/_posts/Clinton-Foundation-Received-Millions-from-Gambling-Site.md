#  Clinton Foundation Received Millions from Gambling Site

The Clinton Foundation has come under fire in the past for receiving millions of dollars in donations from questionable sources. The latest revelation, however, might be the most damning yet.

It has been discovered that the Clinton Foundation received $8 million from a gambling website that was later shut down by the FBI. The site, known as 'Curacao Friendly' allegedly accepted bets from US citizens, which is illegal.

When questioned about the donation, a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation initially claimed that they were not aware of the site's illegal activities. However, subsequent reports have shown that this is not true. In fact, the site was banned from accepting bets from US citizens due to its illegal activity.

This revelation is particularly concerning given that Hillary Clinton is poised to become the next President of the United States. If she is elected, will she continue to receive money from shady sources? Or will she put an end to such practices? Only time will tell.

#  What Was the Biggest Gambling Site to Donate to Clinton?

While it is no secret that there are a number of high-profile gambling establishments that have donated to Hillary Clinton’s election campaign, the question still lingers – who was the biggest?

There are a few contenders for this prestigious title, but one site in particular seems to stand out from the rest. That site is none other than PokerStars.

According to public filings released by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), PokerStars has given a staggering $1.5 million to Clinton’s campaign. This is by far the largest donation made by any gambling company in this election cycle.

In contrast, the next biggest donor is Caesars Entertainment, which has given just $250,000 to Clinton. The only other gambling firm to donate more than $100,000 is MGM Resorts International, which has given $125,000.

So why did PokerStars decide to donate so much money to Clinton? It’s not exactly clear, but some analysts believe that it may be an attempt by the company to curry favor with her administration in case she wins the election.

Clinton is known to be relatively hostile towards online gambling, and she has previously spoken out against it. If she were to win the presidency, it’s possible that she would crack down on online gaming firms like PokerStars.

So it’s possible that PokerStars is trying to get on her good side now, in case things take a turn for the worse after November 8th.

#  Did Clinton Foundation Take Money from Gambling Site?

The Clinton Foundation has been dogged by allegations of corruption for years, and a new report suggests that the organization may have taken money from a gambling site.

According to Fox News, the Clinton Foundation accepted a $1 million donation from Stars Interactive, which is part of the online gaming company Rational Group. Stars Interactive owns the popular gambling site PokerStars.

The revelation is particularly troubling because PokerStars has been dogged by allegations of money laundering and other criminal activities. In fact, the company was fined $731 million by the United States government in 2014 for violating anti-money laundering laws.

The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, but the new report is sure to revive concerns about corruption at the organization.

#  Casino Firm Paid Millions to Clinton Foundation

A recent investigation has shown that the casino firm, MGM Resorts International, had donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation in the years leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The contributions were made as MGM was seeking regulatory approval from the Obama administration for a new casino project in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The news comes as a further example of apparent pay-to-play politics between private businesses and the Clintons, following reports that Clinton had received large speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.

Critics have argued that MGM’s donations could have influenced Clinton’s decisions as Secretary of State regarding MGM’s requests for regulatory approvals. For example, in September 2011, Clinton announced that she was postponing a decision on MGM’s application for a casino license in Macau, which was seen as a major blow to the company.

MGM has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that its donations to the Clinton Foundation were not related to its casino applications. However, some observers have noted that Clinton Foundation donors often received preferential treatment from the Obama administration when it came to winning government contracts and approvals.

The issue is likely to become more controversial in light of the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Some Republicans have alleged that Democratic politicians such as Hillary Clinton were effectively “bought off” by financial contributions from Russia and other foreign interests.

#  Hillary Clinton's Finances Under Scrutiny Again as Gambling Site Donation Surfaces

Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign is already fraught with questions about her finances. The latest revelations concern a donation to the Clinton Foundation from a gambling website.

The $225,000 donation from Paradise Papers- leak participant and gambling website PokerStars was revealed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on Sunday. The donation was made in 2010, during Clinton's abortive run for the Democratic nomination against then-Senator Barack Obama.

Clinton's election campaign spokesperson has said that the donation was made when PokerStars was seeking a license in New Jersey and that it had nothing to do with Clinton herself. PokerStars reportedly gave the same explanation to Reuters when they contacted them for comment.

This is not the first time that Hillary Clinton's finances have come under scrutiny. In 2015, it was revealed that Clinton had earned over $100 million since leaving office as Secretary of State in 2013. much of this income came from paid speeches given by Clinton around the world.

Critics have accused Clinton of being out of touch with ordinary Americans and have cited her high income as evidence that she is unsuitable for public office. In response, Clinton has said that she is "dead broke" when she left the White House in 2001 and that she understands the challenges faced by ordinary Americans.

The latest revelations about Hillary Clinton's finances will likely add to the controversy surrounding her campaign and could damage her chances of winning the presidency in 2016.
