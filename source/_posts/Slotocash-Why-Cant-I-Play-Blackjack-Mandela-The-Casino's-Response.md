#  Slotocash Why Cant I Play Blackjack Mandela: The Casino's Response

What would you do if you couldn't play blackjack at Slotocash? This is the question that many players are asking themselves after the casino allegedly banned the game. While some people are speculating that the casino may have just removed the game temporarily in order to fix a bug, others are convinced that blackjack has been permanently removed from the Slotocash lineup. So what's the scoop?

Slotocash released an official statement addressing the situation, explaining that they made a decision to remove all blackjack games from their library due to consistent player complaints. Apparently, players were unhappy with how the games were being played, and Slotocash didn't want to risk any further negative feedback. The statement goes on to say that blackjack may or may not return to Casino in the future, but for now it's been taken down indefinitely.

This news has definitely come as a shock to many people, especially since blackjack is one of Slotocash's most popular games. But while some players are frustrated by this turn of events, others view it as an opportunity to try out some of the other games in Casino's library. There are plenty of great options available, including slots, roulette and even baccarat. So whether you're disgruntled by the removal of blackjack or excited to explore new options, there's no doubt that Slotocash still has plenty to offer its players.

#  Slotocash halts blackjack play for Mandela

Slotocash, a popular online casino has halted blackjack play, following the announcement that Nelson Mandela has passed away.

A statement on the Slotocash website reads: "The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Slotocash are with the Mandela family during this difficult time. In honor of Nelson Mandela, we are suspending blackjack play until further notice."

#  Slotocash denies playing blackjack with Nelson Mandela

Slotocash, one of the world’s largest online casinos, has denied any wrongdoing after reports surfaced that they had been caught playing blackjack with Nelson Mandela.

The company released a statement earlier today, insisting that they had not violated any laws and that their dealings with Mr. Mandela had been above board. Slotocash also claimed that they did not have any knowledge of Mr. Mandela’s alleged involvement in illegal activities.

The allegations first surfaced on Sunday, when local news outlet IAfrica published a report claiming that Slotocash had been caught playing blackjack with Mr. Mandela at a casino in Johannesburg. The article alleged that the casino was being investigated by South African authorities for possible violations of gambling laws.

Slotocash has denied all of the allegations, saying that they were part of a smear campaign against the company.

Slotocash Casino has announced the suspension of all blackjack games for the time being, due to concerns over Nelson Mandela's health. Slotocash CEO, Erik Norvell, released a statement saying that "out of respect for our former president and global icon, we have decided to suspend all blackjack games until further notice."

Mandela was hospitalized on June 8th for a lung infection, and his condition has continued to deteriorate in recent days. Slotocash joins a growing list of businesses and organizations who are suspending or postponing activities in light of Mandela's illness.

This news comes as a disappointment to many blackjack enthusiasts, who were looking forward to playing at Slotocash during their next visit to Las Vegas. Nevertheless, the decision probably makes sense, given the reverence with which most people regard Mandela. We can only hope that he makes a full recovery and returns to good health soon.

Slotocash Casino has pulled its blackjack games after reports of Nelson Mandela's health have surfaced.

Mandela, 94, was taken to a Pretoria hospital on Wednesday night for a checkup and has been in and out of the hospital multiple times over the past few years.

"Out of respect for Mr. Mandela and his family, we have decided to remove our blackjack games until further notice," a Slotocash Casino spokesperson said in a statement.

The removal of blackjack games comes as a surprise to many as Mandela is not only an international figure, but also an icon in the gambling world. In fact, one online casino is even running a special promotion celebrating Mandela's life.

"It's definitely a bit of a shock that they would pull blackjack just because Nelson Mandela is sick," said one industry insider who asked to remain anonymous. "But I respect their decision."
