#  How to Play Miniature Baccarat Like a Pro - Courtesy of Mark Twain

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Miniature Baccarat is a simplified variation of the game that is enjoyed by many people. If you want to learn how to play this exciting game like a pro, read on.

There are three possible outcomes in Miniature Baccarat - Player, Banker, and Tie. The aim of the game is to bet on one of these outcomes and hope that it comes through. You can either place a bet on the Player or Banker hand, or you can bet on a Tie.

If you're betting on the Player hand, the goal is to get as close to nine as possible without going over. If the player's hand beats the banker's hand, then you win even money on your bet. If the player's hand ties with the banker's hand, then you get your original bet back. If the player's hand loses to the banker's hand, then you lose your bet.

If you're betting on the Banker hand, then the goal is also to get as close to nine as possible without going over, but with one important difference - if the banker's hand beats the player's hand, then you still win even money on your bet. However, if the banker's hand ties with the player's hand or loses to it, then you lose your bet just like with a Player hand wager.

Lastly, if you're betting on a Tie outcome, then your goal is simply to predict that no matter which hands are played out, they will tie and both players will forfeit their bets.

To make a wager in Miniature Baccarat, first decide how much money you want to risk. Then decide which type of wager you would like to make - either on Player, Banker or Tie - and place your chips accordingly. Remember that when placing bets in Miniature Baccarat games at casinos online or off , remember always to use coloured chips for easy identification .

The game begins once all players have placed their bets. The dealer then deals two hands - one for the player and one for the banker. The values of each card are totalled up and any Aces are worth 1 point while tens and face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are all worth 0 points. So a 2 + 5 = 7 card would be worth 7 points in this game variant . 



After all cards have been dealt face down , both players turn over their first two cards . At this point , if either player has an 8 or 9 points total , that player immediately wins . If neither player has 8 or 9 points total , play continues . 



The next card played is turned over bythe person who did not play first in current round - this is called "Card 3" . Play now goes round-by-round clockwise until one of two things happens : 1) one ofthe players reachesthe value of 10 points withthe first two cards (this endsgame immediately ,withthatplayer winning) OR2)bothplayershave two cards leftand their totals are added together . Whoever hasthe higher total (sum ofcards) thenwins that particular round . In eventofties , push result occurs and nobody wins nor losestheirbetsplaces up untilthen .



When both players have only one card left , thatcardis turned over automatically revealingthe winnerofthatround (Playeror Banker). At endofgame , Dealer tallies up all winningbets and loserremitsamounts stakedto thosewho won; Dealer keepstheir own commission (if any) from amount wageredbyPlayerorBankerkiezen

#  Learn From the Master: Tips on How to Win at Miniature Baccarat from Mark Twain

In this article, we will be learning from the master himself, Mark Twain, on how to win at miniature baccarat.

First and foremost, know the game. There are only three possible outcomes in baccarat: player (P), banker (B), and tie (T). Secondly, understand the rules. Each card is worth its face value with an Ace counting as 1 and a 2 through 10 representing their face value. A Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. An 11 point card is counted as 1 point while a 12-point card is counted as 0 points. retained point values are added up to get the total for that particular hand. Thirdly, have discipline! Twain once said “There is no gambling like politics” and this is very true when it comes to gambling in general but especially miniature baccarat. If you take risks that are not calculated ones then you will likely lose your hard earned money. Lastly, study the game!
