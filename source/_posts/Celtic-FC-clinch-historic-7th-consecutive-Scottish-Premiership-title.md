#  Celtic FC clinch historic 7th consecutive Scottish Premiership title

The Celtic FC squad were ecstatic as they clinched their 7th consecutive Scottish Premiership title following a 3-1 victory over Aberdeen at Pittodrie.

Manager Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to his players and staff, "This is an historic achievement and it's been down to the hard work and dedication of everyone at the club. We're delighted to have once again won the Premiership title and I'm really proud of the players and everyone involved."

The championship was sealed with three games to spare thanks to goals from Odsonne Edouard, James Forrest and Mikael Lustig. It's Celtic's 52nd league championship and extends their unbeaten domestic run to 65 matches.

Celtic captain Scott Brown said, "It's a huge honour to captain this team and be a part of such a fantastic era. We're going for an unprecedented treble-treble now and we'll do everything we can to make that happen."

Celtic will look to add the Scottish Cup and League Cup to their trophy cabinet in the coming weeks as they continue their bid for an unprecedented treble-treble.

#  Brendan Rodgers: 'The players were immense today'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised his players’ efforts after their 3-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford.

“I thought the players were immense today,” Rodgers told reporters in his post-match press conference. “They were aggressive and looked a real threat going forward. The front three was outstanding and they caused United all sorts of problems.”

Mario Balotelli was Liverpool’s star performer on the day, scoring two goals and assisting Raheem Sterling for the other. Rodgers was delighted with Balotelli’s contribution and hailed him as a real “team player”.

“Mario has been working hard in training and it was great to see him get on the scoresheet today,” said Rodgers. “He played a great team game today and worked well with his teammates. I’m really pleased with his performance.”

Liverpool now sit just two points behind fourth place Chelsea in the Premier League table, and Rodgers is confident that his side can still qualify for the Champions League this season.

“We know we have games in hand over the teams around us and we can still make it into the top four,” he said. “The players are up for the challenge and I am sure we can achieve our goal.”

#  Celtic FC keep their unbeaten run going with a 1-0 victory over Motherwell

Celtic FC maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Motherwell at Fir Park. The only goal of the game came from French striker Odsonne Edouard, who headed home in the first half following a well-worked move from the home side. Celtic now have thirteen points from their five league games so far this season and sit top of the table, two points clear of second-placed Aberdeen.

Motherwell goalkeeper Trevor Carson was in fine form throughout, making a number of good saves to keep his side in the game. However, Celtic were always likely to take the three points on offer and move another step closer to defending their Premiership title. The win also saw Brendan Rodgers’ men make it six consecutive clean sheets in all competitions.

There was little between the two sides during an evenly-contested first half, with both teams creating chances but failing to take them. The opener eventually arrived in the 38th minute, when Olivier Ntcham played a delightful ball over the top of Motherwell’s defence for Edouard to head home.

After the break, Motherwell came out fighting and they should have equalised midway through the second half but Louis Moult somehow headed wide from six yards out with the goal gaping. This proved to be a costly miss as Celtic saw out the rest of the game to take all three points.

It was an impressive team performance from Rodgers’ men, who are now looking like early favourites for back-to-back titles. With Champions League football also on offer this season, Celtic will be confident of going far in all four competitions they are competing in this year.

#  Tom Rogic strike seals Celtic's latest triumph

Celtic scripted another memorable night in their history book as they emerged victorious against RB Leipzig. A Tom Rogic thunderbolt midway through the second half decided the contest and ensured Brendan Rodgers's side will compete in the Europa League knockout stages.

Leipzig carried a threat throughout and created several good chances but they were unable to find a way past Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon. The Germans finished with ten men, following Amadou Haidara's red card late on.

It was an excellent result for Celtic, who are on course to reach the last 32 of Europe's second-tier competition. Their reward for victory is a tie against Valencia next month.

Gordon made two important saves from Marcel Sabitzer and Timo Werner in the first half, but it was Celtic who took the lead shortly after the restart. Rogic collected a pass from Kieran Tierney on the edge of the area and thrashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner.

Leipzig pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages but they were unable to breach a well-organised Celtic defence. Haidara was shown a red card for a high challenge on James Forrest in injury time, completing a disappointing night for the German club.

#  Celtic make it seven in a row with hard-fought win

Celtic made it seven consecutive wins in all competitions with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over St.Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. Goals from Olivier Ntcham and James Forrest gave Brendan Rodgers' side the three points, despite Blair Alston pulling one back for the home side.

The visitors had the better of the opening exchanges and created several chances, but could not take any of them. They eventually took the lead in the 36th minute when Ntcham arrowed a shot into the top corner from outside the area. Forrest then doubled their advantage in first-half stoppage time, firing home after being teed up by Scott Sinclair.

Alston pulled one back for St.Johnstone in the 63rd minute, but Celtic held on to secure all three points. The victory means that they maintain their 100% record in the Scottish Premiership and move eight points clear of second-placed Rangers.
